              Tomorrow will mark a year since I had my stroke. It's an occasion
              that, according to my daughter, Ginny, I should view as important.
              But I've spent enough time staring at death; I don't want to think
              about the 364 days behind me. The only thing I care about right
              now is the dirt track ahead of me and the fog that's just hit the
              tops of the eucalyptus trees.I'm leaning against a cane on the
              gravel track that forms a circle above the old polo field at
              Golden Gate Park. Ginny is swiping around on her cell phone on a
              bench just behind me. Around us, a dozen or so strangers walk,
              bike, and run around this great circle, while the fenced-off
              soccer field below is inhabited only by a flock of geese pecking
              worms out of the wet earth. I hand the cane to Ginny and kiss her
              cheek. She smiles exactly like Petra did—all lips, her eyes nearly
              closed."See you soon, pup," I say."Wave at me if you need
              anything, Pop."I walk, bobbing up and down as my feet scrape
              through the gravel. I leave a trail that looks more like tire
              tracks than footprints. Scrape-scrape, scrape-scrape.
